Submitting tickets
==================

One of the primary ways that the Customer can interact with Rackspace is by
creating a ticket in the `Rackspace Customer Portal
<https://login.rackspace.com/login>`_. After login, click the Tickets button from
the menu to create a new ticket or view an existing ticket. The Rackspace
automated systems also create tickets for events on the Customer’s account that
require either the Customer’s attention or the attention of a Rackspace
employee. The Customer can also call the 24x7x365 support team at any time.


- **Standard:** If the Customer’s site is functioning within acceptable
  parameters, but the Customer requires assistance in loading software or
  have a help desk-type question, Rackspace responds to the Customer’s initial
  request within four hours.

- **Urgent:** If the Customer’s server or site is accessible but in a reduced
  state (timeouts or slow response), Rackspace responds to Customer’s initial
  support request within one hour.

- **Emergency:** If the Customer can’t access their server or site from the public
  internet, Rackspace responds within 15 minutes.
